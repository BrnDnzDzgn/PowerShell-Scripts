In this repository you can find many PowerShell scripts which were written by me. Each script are independent from one another and each script written for a reason. You can freely choose the script which will work for you.
Here is the description of each script:

Note: you should login with an account which has the permissions to do the tasks. Also take a look at the comments inside the script, so that it will work seamlessly.
